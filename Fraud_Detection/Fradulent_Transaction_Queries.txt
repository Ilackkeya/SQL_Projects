SELECT * FROM transaction
WHERE EXTRACT(HOUR FROM date) NOT BETWEEN 6 AND 22;


Query: Find the top 100 highest transactions during early morning hours (7-9 AM)

SELECT *
FROM transaction
WHERE EXTRACT(HOUR FROM date) BETWEEN 7 AND 9
ORDER BY amount DESC
LIMIT 100;

Query: Count transactions less than $2.00 per cardholder to check for hacked cards

SELECT cc.id_card_holder, COUNT(*) AS low_value_transaction_count
FROM transaction t
JOIN credit_card cc ON t.card = cc.card
WHERE t.amount < 2.00
GROUP BY cc.id_card_holder
HAVING COUNT(*) > 0;

Query: Identify the top 5 merchants prone to being hacked with small transactions

SELECT m.id, m.name, COUNT(*) AS small_transaction_count
FROM transaction t
JOIN merchant m ON t.id_merchant = m.id
WHERE t.amount < 2.00
GROUP BY m.id, m.name
ORDER BY small_transaction_count DESC
LIMIT 5;

Query: Create views for reusable queries

CREATE VIEW early_morning_transactions AS
SELECT t.id, t.date, t.amount, t.card, t.id_merchant
FROM transaction t
WHERE EXTRACT(HOUR FROM t.date) BETWEEN 7 AND 9;


CREATE VIEW high_value_transactions AS
SELECT t.id, t.date, t.amount, t.card, t.id_merchant
FROM transaction t
WHERE t.amount > 1000;

CREATE VIEW small_amount_transactions_per_cardholder AS
SELECT cc.id_card_holder, COUNT(*) AS low_value_transaction_count
FROM transaction t
JOIN credit_card cc ON t.card = cc.card
WHERE t.amount < 2.00
GROUP BY cc.id_card_holder;

CREATE VIEW top_merchants_prone_to_hacking AS
SELECT m.id, m.name, COUNT(*) AS small_transaction_count
FROM transaction t
JOIN merchant m ON t.id_merchant = m.id
WHERE t.amount < 2.00
GROUP BY m.id, m.name
ORDER BY small_transaction_count DESC;
