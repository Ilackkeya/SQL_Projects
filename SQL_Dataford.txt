Challenge 1:

Airbnb Apartment Count

Write a query to find the number of apartments per nationality that are owned by people under 30 years old. Output the nationality along with the number of apartments.

airbnb_hosts table:

Column Name	Description
host_id	Identifier for each host
age	Age of the host
gender	Gender of the host
nationality	Nationality of the host
airbnb_units table:

Column Name	Description
host_id	Identifier for the host
unit_id	Identifier for each unit

Solution:

SELECT ah.nationality, COUNT(au.unit_id) as Apartment_count
FROM airbnb_hosts as ah
JOIN airbnb_units as au
ON ah.host_id = au.host_id
WHERE ah.age < 30
GROUP BY ah.nationality

Challenge 2:

Speech Recognition

You have recently joined Apple's speech recognition team and have been assigned a task to evaluate the consistency across different voice-enabled device types in rendering text responses. There are five distinct tables named table1, table2, table3, table4, and table5.

Each of these tables contains the following columns:

Column Name	Description
device_type	Type of the device (Siri, Alexa, etc.)
device_id	Unique identifier of the specific device
feature	Main feature of the device being used
text	Text processed by the device
Your objective is to write a SQL query that identifies texts that are rendered by at least three different device types.

For instance, if Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant all render the text "Hi, how is your day?" in response to a particular speech input, that text should be included in your result.

Solution:

SELECT text
FROM (
    SELECT text, device_type FROM table1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT text, device_type FROM table2
    UNION ALL
    SELECT text, device_type FROM table3
    UNION ALL
    SELECT text, device_type FROM table4
    UNION ALL
    SELECT text, device_type FROM table5
) combined_results
GROUP BY text
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT (device_type))>=3

Challenge 3:

Card Launch Success

Your team at JPMorgan Chase is preparing to launch a new credit card and needs to estimate how many cards will be issued in its first month.

Your task is to write a SQL query to find out how many cards were issued in the first month of previous card launches. The query should display each credit card's name alongside the quantity issued in its launch month.

Hint: To identify the launch month, refer to the earliest record for each card

monthly_cards_issued table:

Column Name	Description
issue_month	The month the redit card was issued
issue_year	The year the credit card was issued
card_name	The name of the credit card
issued_amount	The number of credit cards issued

SOLUTION:

WITH card_launch AS (
    SELECT
        card_name,
        issued_amount,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY card_name ORDER BY issue_year) AS rnk_year,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY card_name, issue_year ORDER BY issue_month) AS rnk_month
    FROM
        monthly_cards_issued
        )

SELECT card_name, issued_amount
FROM card_launch
WHERE rnk_year = 1 AND rnk_month = 1

CHALLENGE 4:

Given a table of tweets with their respective hashtags, write a SQL query to find the top K (K=2) most frequently mentioned hashtags in the table.

tweets table:

Column Name	Description
id	Unique identifier for each tweet
tweet_text	Text content of the tweet
hashtags	Hashtags associated with the tweet


SOLUTION:

WITH my_hashtags AS (
SELECT 
    REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_TABLE(hashtags, ', ') AS hashtag
FROM tweets

)

SELECT 
    hashtag, 
    COUNT(*) AS count
FROM my_hashtags
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 2
